## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I am Mario.**
* I am a freelance software engineer. Interested in backends, but fullstack by accident.
* Did you know that you can hire me for your next project or idea? Check out [https://portfolio-git-main-marios-projects-b26ec75a.vercel.app/][ddev] for more information.
* You can find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow] and [Mastodon][mastodon].

**Here are some of my personal programming facts.**
* My favourite languages are Python, Go and Ruby. I also enjoy Java and PHP.
* Vue > jQuery > React. However, I prefer Nuxt for fullstack JavaScript apps.
* Atomic CSS is a mistake that mankind will eventually pay for. However, in this house we respect [UnoCSS].

**Here are some of the repositories in this profile I think you will probably like.**
* My [dotfiles][dotfiles], my [vimrc][vimrc]
