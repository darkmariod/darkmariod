## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

**I am Mario.**  
* I am a freelance software engineer. Interested in backends, but fullstack by accident.  
* Did you know that you can hire me for your next project or idea? Check out [my portfolio](https://portfolio-git-main-marios-projects-b26ec75a.vercel.app/) for more information.  
* You can find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin], [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow], and [Mastodon][mastodon].

**Here are some of my personal programming facts.**  
* My favourite languages are Python, Go, and Ruby. I also enjoy Java and PHP.  
* Vue > jQuery > React. However, I prefer Nuxt for fullstack JavaScript apps.  
* Atomic CSS is a mistake that mankind will eventually pay for. However, in this house we respect [UnoCSS].  

**Here are some of the repositories in this profile I think you will probably like.**
